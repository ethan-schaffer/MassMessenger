This code uses the Twilio API to send text messages from a Python script. In order to keep some information secret, the `file_phone_numbers` file is not included in this repository. 

Because the original history of this repository included commits that had PII in them, I chose to put the final, finished version of the code here without a commit history. 

You can find the work I did at https://github.com/ethan-schaffer/MassMessenger/blob/master/MassMessenger.py.
